         <h1>Strengthening your JavaScript skills: Neuroplasticity</h1>

           <h3 id=“titles”>Have you ever wondered why the old adage <q>Practice makes perfect</q> stands true time and time again when learning a new skill?</h3>
         <p>With new advances in brain imaging, known as <b>fMRI</b>, neuroscientists have been able to begin to understand how the brain <q>learns</q>.</p><img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S091160441400061X-gr2.jpg"><p>Only a few decades ago, it was believed that once an adolescent reached adulthood, not much new mental or behavioral learning could occur. <p>Here's a popular idiom: <q>You can't teach an old dog new trick.<q/><p><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/ab/1d/d3/ab1dd3ae3d4224ee05324fff4039d951--good-things-funny-things.jpg" width="350" height="300"></p><p>Oh but you can! Well, maybe not JavaScript. Although this phrase relates more to personal opinions and behaviors, the same concept holds true.</p><p>Now we know that learning is a matter of training the brain to change and rewire itself to form new neural connections. With continued practice, these neural connections become stronger - or weaker - through synaptic transmission, thus less effort is put into <q>thinking</q>, and becomes more automatic. This is known as <em>neuroplasticity.</em></p></article></div>

          <h3 id=“titles”>How does neuroplasticity help learn JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>When learning any new skill - like a new musical instrument, learning to drive a car, or a programming language - there is a steep learning curve due to the brain just not having any experience with the particular task.<p/><p>When we first saw <q>console.log(<q>Hello, World!</q>);</q>, did you know what it meant?</p><p>As we read through the Course Book, practice exercises, attend lectures, and ask/share questions with colleagues, we are forming new pathways in the brain. As we continue to learn more code, and revisit learned material, we are strengthening the neural pathways that allows the brain to quickly recall and modify constructed memory. Over time, our level of expertise is increased, especially as we encounter new situations that we then create new neural pathway for.</p><p>So, when you feel like you want to toss your not-at-fault-computer across the room because your code won't behave as intended, just remember, you are feeding your brain new information. It takes time and repetition for it to create strong neural pathways and a good foundation from which to build on. So keep at it. Eventually, you'll be unstoppable!</p><p><b><img src = "https://mindmapusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Neuro-plasticity-and-training.png" alt="Gotta keep it up" width="450" height="400"></b></p></article></div>
